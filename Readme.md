#JavaBruteForce

A Brute Force application written in Java. Currently able to break 5 characters password from all small letter alphabets and a special character "!". More characters can be added to the iterable list i.e. Capital alphabets, any number as type(string) and any special characters as type(string). Note that the lengthier the array, the more time it will take to break the password.

To run the program no prerequisites are needed.

More lengthier passswords can be added to be cracked. For that a few things need to be added:
1. String n_characters = "";
2. n number of nested loops where is says "// Add sixth-character iteration if more needed"
